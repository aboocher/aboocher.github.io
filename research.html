                <p>
                    My research broadly concerns interactions between algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and
                    commutative
                    algebra. I am particularly interested
                    in studying the way in which geometric information is preserved (or changed) upon
                    deformation. Using
                    these techniques I've been able to better understand the minimal free resolution and minimal
                    generating sets of many classes of ideals arising from determinants, matroids, and graphs.
                    It has
                    also allowed us to better understand the way that the deviations of algebras (which are
                    determined
                    by its Poincar&eacute; series) behave.
                    <br> <br>
                    Recently, I've been very interested in bounding the Betti numbers of certain classes of
                    algebras.
                    For instance in work with Srikanth Iyengar and Hamid Hassanzadeh we look at whether the
                    upper bounds
                    on the Betti numbers implied by the Taylor Complex hold for arbitrary Koszul algebras.
                    On the other hand, with Jimmy Seiner, I've studied lower bounds for Betti numbers of
                    monomial
                    ideals.

                <h4>Undergraduate Research</h4>
                I enjoy working on research projects with undergraduates in a variety of settings. If
                you are interested in an <b> indepedent study </b> course, please let me know! Below are some
                documents from previous work with students:

                <li> From 2018 - 2023, I have supervised many students on independent study reading course and research
                    projects.

                        <li> Valerie Gilbert (Honors Thesis on Minimal Free Resolutions and Betti Numbers) <a

                    </ul>
                <li>In Summer 2016, I supervised Jimmy Seiner (U. Michigan) on a project in
                    commutative
                    algebra and
                    homological algebra. We continued working after the summer on variants of the
                    Buchsbaum-Eisenbud-Horrocks Rank Conjecture. Our paper is available <a
                        href="files/boocherseiner.pdf">here</a>.
                <li>In 2013, I co-organized an REU at UC Berkeley with two other graduate students. We
                    directed a
                    total of 17
                    undergraduates in three research projects. The REU was funded by the Geometry and
                    Topology
                    RTG.
                    My group
                    of 6 students studied a problem in Combinatorial Commutative Algebra concerning toric
                    ideals.

                    Our paper <a href="files/robustgraphideals.pdf">Robust Graph Ideals</a> appears in the Annals of
                    Combinatorics.
                    The students gave two presentations at a conference we organized with Stanford University. Their
                    presentations: <br>

                    (Students advised: Bryan Brown, Timothy Duff, Laura Lymna, Takumi Murayama, Amy Nesky, Karl
                    Schaefer)
                <li>
                    In the Summer of 2008 I had the great joy to direct a reading REU at the University
                    of Notre Dame. I worked with three undergraduate students (Joshn Mollner, Kaitlyn Moran and
                    Emma Whitten) on the topic of algebraic
                    geometry. The students learned a short course in algebraic geometry and wrote expository
                    papers and
                    presented at Mathfest. Their papers and presentations from MathFest are posted below. I'm
                    really happy with
                    how they turned out. I think they would be good for a first read in any of these interesting
                    areas.

The second half of the semester was devoted to open-ended projects where students read expository or research papers and gave presentations. Group project titles included "The Fundamental Group", "An Introduction to Lattice Knots and Lattice Stick Numbers", "Moebius Transformations, Geodesics, and Knot Energy", and  "The part knot theory plays in quantum money."
