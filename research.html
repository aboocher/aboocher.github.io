            <p>
                My research broadly concerns interactions between algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and
                commutative
                algebra. I am particularly interested
                in studying the way in which geometric information is preserved (or changed) upon
                deformation. Using
                these techniques I've been able to better understand the minimal free resolution and minimal
                generating sets of many classes of ideals arising from determinants, matroids, and graphs.
                It has
                also allowed us to better understand the way that the deviations of algebras (which are
                determined
                by its Poincar&eacute; series) behave.
                <br> <br>
                Recently, I've been very interested in bounding the Betti numbers of certain classes of
                algebras.
                For instance in work with Srikanth Iyengar and Hamid Hassanzadeh we look at whether the
                upper bounds
                on the Betti numbers implied by the Taylor Complex hold for arbitrary Koszul algebras.
                On the other hand, with Jimmy Seiner, I've studied lower bounds for Betti numbers of
                monomial
                ideals.

            <h4>Undergraduate Research</h4>
            I enjoy working on research projects with undergraduates in a variety of settings. If
            you are interested in an <b> independent study </b> course, please let me know! Below are some
            documents from previous work with students:

            <li> From 2018 - 2023, I have supervised many students on independent study reading course and
                research
                projects.

                </ul>
            <li>In Summer 2016, I supervised Jimmy Seiner (U. Michigan) on a project in
                commutative
                algebra and
                homological algebra. We continued working after the summer on variants of the
                Buchsbaum-Eisenbud-Horrocks Rank Conjecture. Our paper is available <a
                    href="files/boocherseiner.pdf">here</a>.
            <li>In 2013, I co-organized an REU at UC Berkeley with two other graduate students. We
                directed a
                total of 17
                undergraduates in three research projects. The REU was funded by the Geometry and
                Topology
                RTG.
                My group
                of 6 students studied a problem in Combinatorial Commutative Algebra concerning toric
                ideals.

                Our paper <a href="files/robustgraphideals.pdf">Robust Graph Ideals</a> appears in the Annals of
                Combinatorics.
                The students gave two presentations at a conference we organized with Stanford University. Their
                presentations: <br>

            <li>
                In the Summer of 2008 I had the great joy to direct a reading REU at the University
                of Notre Dame. I worked with three undergraduate students (Joshn Mollner, Kaitlyn Moran and
                Emma Whitten) on the topic of algebraic
                geometry. The students learned a short course in algebraic geometry and wrote expository
                papers and
                presented at Mathfest. Their papers and presentations from MathFest are posted below. I'm
                really happy with
                how they turned out. I think they would be good for a first read in any of these interesting
                areas.
