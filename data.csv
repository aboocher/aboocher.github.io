What is the definition of a strict inequality?,For any real numbers $a$ and $b$, $a \neq b$ implies $a < b$,$a \neq b$ implies $a \leq b$,$a \neq b$ implies $a > b$,$a \neq b$ implies $a \geq b$,For any real numbers $a$ and $b$, $a \neq b$ implies $a < b$,"In a strict inequality, the inequality sign ($<$ or $>$) implies that the values being compared are not equal. If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $a \neq b$, then $a < b$ means $a$ is strictly less than $b$."
Which property of inequalities allows us to add the same number to both sides of an inequality?,Reflexive property,Transitive property,Addition property of inequalities,Multiplication property of inequalities,Addition property of inequalities,"The addition property of inequalities states that for any real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, if $a < b$, then $a + c < b + c$. In other words, we can add the same number to both sides of an inequality without changing the direction of the inequality."
What is the correct order of operations for solving an inequality?,Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right),Parentheses, Exponents, Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), Multiplication and Division (from left to right),Exponents, Parentheses, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right),Exponents, Parentheses, Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), Multiplication and Division (from left to right),Parentheses, Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right),"When solving an inequality, the correct order of operations is as follows: 1) Evaluate expressions inside parentheses, 2) Simplify exponents, 3) Perform multiplication and division from left to right, 4) Perform addition and subtraction from left to right."
What is the solution set of the inequality $3x + 4 < 10$?,{$x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x < 2$},{$x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x > 2$},{$x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x < 6$},{$x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x > 6$},{$x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x < 2$},"To find the solution set of the inequality $3x + 4 < 10$, we can solve it like an equation by subtracting 4 from both sides: $3x < 6$. Then, dividing both sides by 3 gives $x < 2$. Therefore, the solution set is {$x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x < 2$}."
