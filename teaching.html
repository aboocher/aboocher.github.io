        <h2> Notes, Interactive Worksheets, Homework and Quizzes:</h2>
        For many years now, I have been teaching in a way that uses interactive classroom worksheets for each
        lesson. Sometimes these are outlines of lecture notes with examples, and they often also include problems
        for discussion.

                I taught at the

                and Andrew Ranicki. (Updated August 2023)
            <li> <b> Workshop for High School Teachers</b> - In Summer 2017, with Troy Jones and Ray Barton, I organized
                a workshop for high
                school teachers in Sandy, Utah. The theme was symmetry, and here is a link to some of the <a

        <h2> Projects </h2>
        <h3> Larger Scale (Calculus I) Projects </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="files/Treasure.pdf">Concerning our Hero Percy Precal</a>: a 3-part project where all three
                parts are independent.
                In the three parts, "Math on the Beach", "The Locked Chest", and "Elvis?", you will help the whimisical
                hero find hidden treasure.
            <li><a href="files/Calculia.pdf">The Mysterious Orb Incident in the Land of Calculia</a>: a 3-part fairly
                non-linear project.
                There is a story about math, friendship, and treachery at the grand festival in a land far away,
                including over 100 potential suspects. Students will have to narrow down the list of suspects one step
                at a time by first figuring out when is the day of the festival, who dropped the orb, and then finally,
                who was running along the beach!
            <li><a href="files/Halloween.pdf">Hallowe'en Party</a>: a 3-part fairly non-linear project. Terrifying
                ghostly appearances have
                been plaguing the San Diego area and mathematics students are called in to help identify the ghoul.
                Students will narrow down the list of suspects by navigating a corn maze, unrvaeling the mystery of the
                tower, and optimizing a swim-run scenario.
        </ul>
        <h3> Mini-Projects </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A collection of <a href="files/Mini.pdf">mini-projects for a Discrete Math Class</a> - in the context of
                my course,
                students had to
                choose a total of 4 different projects to complete. Projects include questions about graph theory,
                quantifiers, 1-1 and onto functions, induction, proof by contradiction and number theory.
            <li>A <a href="files/LeastSquares.pdf">bare-bones introduction to least-squares and inner products</a> for a
                linear algebra class.
                At the end
                there is a brief discussion about Fourier Series and how inner products can be defined between
                functions. It culminates with one of my favorite facts, namely that $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty
                \frac{1}{n^2} =
                \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3> Experimental </h3>
        <p>
            As a side project, I'm trying to learn some Javascript to create a place to <a
                href="analysis.html">practice</a> your Real Analysis skills. This page is very much under construction.
